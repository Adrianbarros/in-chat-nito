## React base built according to this tutorial.
[Create React App Express Backend](https://daveceddia.com/create-react-app-express-backend/)

For those with Windows running a linux bash you can do so by installing a nodeenv environment. Follow the instructions here -> [Nodeenv](https://github.com/ekalinin/nodeenv)

## Run Program
In the root directory run `PORT=3001 node ./bin/www`

In another terminal go to _client_ folder and run `npm start` 

You should be able to access the front-end in `http://localhost:3000`

I added user info on the backend to test and it can be accessed at `http://localhost:3001/users'
